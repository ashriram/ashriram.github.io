 Arrvindh is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca).

Arrvindh is broadly interested in systems architecture, with specific emphasis on the hardware and interaction of hardware with software. My current area of work include energy management, [accelerator architectures](), and [energy efficient memory hierarchies](). I continue to focus on hardware support for parallelism, synchronization and improving reliability of software. Arrvindh has published on parallel programming, cache coherence protocols, and compiler frameworks for hardware accelerators. He dreams about the use of computers as the brains behind mechanically controlled components in everything from automotive engines to building HVAC systems.

Arrvindh Shriraman is the recipient of a 2011 NSERC Discovery Early Career 
Supplement award, a 2014 IBM Faculty Award and received an IEEE TopPicks award in 2013   

Arrvindh Shriraman received his PhD from the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Rochester working with Prof. Sandhya Dwarkadas and Prof. Michael Scott for his work on hardware transactional memory and synchronization. Based on this background, he continues
to be interested in parallel systems.
